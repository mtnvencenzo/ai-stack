## Getting Started

Choose your setup path based on your needs:

- **Docker Compose only** - If you just want to run the stacks using Docker Compose, follow the [Docker Setup Guide](./docker-setup/README.md) to install and configure Docker.
- **Kubernetes (k3d)** - If you plan to run a local Kubernetes cluster, follow the [Kubernetes Installation Guide](./INSTALL_K8S.md) which includes Docker installation along with k3d, Rancher, and ArgoCD setup.

## Prerequisites

- Docker 24+ and Docker Compose v2

## Usage

Each stack is self-contained with its own `docker-compose.yml` and documentation. Navigate to the stack directory and follow the README instructions to start the services.
