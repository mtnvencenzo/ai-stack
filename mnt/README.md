## Volume mount structure for docker-compose containers
This directory contains the volume structure and assumes a local path beginning in your home directory.  

The path `"${HOME}/ai-stack/"` should exist and contains the structure starting with /mnt

```bash
# Example
ls "${HOME}/ai-stack/mnt/qdrant"
```
