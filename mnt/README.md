## Volume mount structure for docker-compose containers
This directory contains the overall structure requried but assumes a local path beggining in your home directory. 

The path `"${HOME}/ai-stack/"` should exist and contains the structure starting with /mnt

```bash
# Example
ls "${HOME}/ai-stack/mnt/qdrant"
```
